## Libraries

0x Instant has the library `0x Instant UI component` that users will see  and is powered by 0x API. Check out the `0x API` documentation [here](https://0x.org/docs/api).


## Affiliate Fees

As an end host of 0x Instant, you can charge users a fee on all trades made through Instant with the `affiliateFee` option. Simply specify an ethereum address and feePercentage (up to 5%), and a percentage of each transaction will be deposited into the specified address (denominated in the bought tokens).

# UI Integration

The 0x Instant UI powered by 0x API are bundled together in a convenient JS package for you. You can either download and serve the package yourself, or use the CDN-hosted version from 0x.

# Examples


## With token list

Check all others token lists on [List Repository](https://tokenlists.org/) or create one following the [specification](https://github.com/Uniswap/token-lists) and host it on Github

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        tokenList: 'https://tokens.coingecko.com/uniswap/all.json',
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Providing your own provider

This will give you more control over what provider is passed in and where RPC calls are directed

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        orderSource: 'https://api.0x.org/sra/',
        provider: window.ethereum,
        walletDisplayName: 'Trust Wallet',
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Providing a Default Token In

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
       defaultSelectedTokenIn: '0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498'
    },
    'body',
);
```

## Providing your own callback handler

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        onSuccess: txHash => {
            console.log('Success! Transaction hash is: ' + txHash);
        },
    },
    'body',
);
```

# Learn about affiliate fees

As an end host of 0x Instant, you can charge users a fee on all trades made through Instant with the `affiliateFee` option. Simply specify an ethereum address and feePercentage (up to 5%), and a percentage of each transaction will be deposited into the specified address (denominated in ETH).

Example: 3% of transaction volume (in ETH) will be deposited into 0x50ff5828a216170cf224389f1c5b0301a5d0a230

```typescript
zeroExInstant.render(
    {
        affiliateInfo: {
            feeRecipient: '0x50ff5828a216170cf224389f1c5b0301a5d0a230',
            feePercentage: 0.03,
        },
    },
    'body',
);
```

# FAQs

## General

### Q: What is a SignedOrder?

A SignedOrder is a basic primitive of the 0x protocol. You can think of the SignedOrder as a set of parameters that define the terms of a trade, plus a signature that proves that the creator (also known as the 'maker') of an order has approved the trade. For example, a SignedOrder can specify: address A wants to trade 5 REP tokens in exchange for 1 WETH token.

The order includes a signature produced by address A's private key which is the signed hash of the order parameters. For exact JavaScript / TypeScript definition of a SignedOrder, refer to our [docs](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/development/packages/types/src/index.ts#L40).

### Q: What is the Standard Relayer API?

The Standard relayer API is an HTTP specification that facilitates discovering and publishing SignedOrders. As an integrator of 0x Instant you will want to grab an API url from the [Relayer Registry](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-relayer-registry/blob/master/relayers.json). Check out the exact specification of the API in the [documentation](http://sra3-spec.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

### Q: What is a provider?

Check out this [article](/docs/guides/web3-provider-explained) in the guides section for an explanation of web3 providers. A dApp developer typically grabs this object from window.ethereum or window.web3.currentProvider. For advanced usage of providers check out the [examples](/docs/guides/web3-provider-explained#web3-provider-examples) of how to create your own providers

### Q: How can I check liquidity of an asset prior to rendering Instant?

There is a helper method available at `zeroExInstant.hasLiquidityForAssetDataAsync` which takes in an assetData string and order source (Standard Relayer API url or an array of signed orders) and returns a Promise which resolves a boolean value indicating if there is an liquidity available for a given assetData.

<CodeTabs tabs={['html']}>

```html
<div id="liquidityContainer">Loading...</div>
<script>
    const erc20TokenAddress = '0xd26114cd6EE289AccF82350c8d8487fedB8A0C07';
    const assetData = zeroExInstant.assetDataForERC20TokenAddress(erc20TokenAddress);

    zeroExInstant.hasLiquidityForAssetDataAsync(assetData, 'https://api.0x.org/sra/').then(l => {
        document.getElementById('liquidityContainer').innerHTML = `Relayer has liquidity: ${l ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`;
    });
</script>
```

</CodeTabs>

Codepen [example](https://codepen.io/dekz/pen/yLLmbrV)

### Q: What is assetData?

As we now support multiple [token transfer proxies](/docs/guides/v3-specification#assetproxy), the identifier of which proxy to use for the token transfer must be encoded, along with the token information. Each proxy in 0x has a unique identifier. If you're using `@0x/contract-wrappers` there are helper methods for this [encoding](https://0x.org/docs/tools/contract-wrappers#encodeerc20assetdata) and [decoding](https://0x.org/docs/tools/contract-wrappers#decodeerc20assetdata).

The identifier for the Proxy uses a similar scheme to [ABI function selectors](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI#function-selector).

```
// ERC20 Proxy ID  0xf47261b0
bytes4(keccak256("ERC20Token(address)"))
// ERC721 Proxy ID 0x02571792
bytes4(keccak256("ERC721Token(address,uint256)"))
```

Asset data is encoded using [ABI encoding](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html).

For example, encoding the ERC20 token contract (address: 0x1dc4c1cefef38a777b15aa20260a54e584b16c48) using the ERC20 Transfer Proxy (id: 0xf47261b0) would be:

```
0xf47261b00000000000000000000000001dc4c1cefef38a777b15aa20260a54e584b16c48
```

Encoding the ERC721 token contract (address: `0x371b13d97f4bf77d724e78c16b7dc74099f40e84`), token id (id: `99`, which hex encoded is `0x63`) and the ERC721 Transfer Proxy (id: `0x02571792`) would be:

```
0x02571792000000000000000000000000371b13d97f4bf77d724e78c16b7dc74099f40e840000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000063
```

For convenience, zeroExInstant exposes a `zeroExInstant.assetDataForERC20TokenAddress` method, which returns the `assetData` for a given ERC20 address.

For more information see [the Asset Proxy](/docs/guides/v3-specification#erc20proxy) section of the v3 spec and the [Ethereum ABI Spec](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html).

### Q: What is assetMetaData?

In order to provide a good user experience, Instant requires data that is not available on-chain. This includes the `decimals`, `symbol` and `name` of the token along with optional information like `primaryColor`, and `iconUrl` that informs Instant how to theme itself when that token is selected. It also requires to know whether the token is ERC20 or some other standard via the assetProxyId field.

The keys in this mapping are the `assetData` (see "What is assetData?" above) for the corresponding token.

**Example assetMetaDataMap**

```js
{
    '0xf47261b0000000000000000000000000744d70fdbe2bc4cf95131626614a1764df805b9e': {
        assetProxyId: '0xf47261b0', // ERC20 Proxy Id
        decimals: 18,
        symbol: 'XXX',
        name: 'My Custom Token',
        primaryColor: '#F2F7FF', // Optional
        iconUrl: 'https://cdn.icons.com/my_icon.svg', // Optional
    },

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| assetProxyId            | Only ERC20 is supported and the value for assetProxyId should always be “0xf47261b0” |
| decimals                | The number of decimal places this token requires                                     |
| symbol                  | The token symbol (ex: `ZRX`, `BAT`, etc...)                                          |
| name                    | The full name of the token (ex: `0x`, `Basic Attention Token`, etc...)               |
| primaryColor (optional) | The color Instant will theme itself when this token is selected                      |
| iconUrl (optional)      | The url to the icon to use for this token                                            |

The icon referenced by `iconUrl` will go on top of a 26x26 circle that has `primaryColor` as a background. If an `iconUrl` is not provided, the specified token `symbol` will be displayed over the circle in white.

We provide assetMetaData for a subset of ERC20 tokens. You can call the helper function `zeroExInstant.hasMetaDataForAssetData` which returns a boolean indiciating whether or not we have assetMetaData for a given assetData string.

## Mobile

### Q: How can I make 0x Instant work in my mobile app?

For apps using React Native or apps that have a web view, the Asset Swapper engine will work out of the box with your application. For apps that are written in a native language like Java or Swift, you will need to wrap the asset-swapper logic in a JS interpreter.

## Affiliates

### Q: How do I make money as an affiliate?

If you host 0x Instant, you can designate an address that you own to receive a small % of ETH that users spend on assets. The fee percent maxes out at 5%. You can configure this in the AffiliateInfo setting.
